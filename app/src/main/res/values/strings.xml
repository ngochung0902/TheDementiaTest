    <!-- Tool  -->

    <string name="tool">Tool</string>
    <string name="thisisasc">About This Tool: This is a screening instrument based upon current psychology and neuroscience research as well as the extensive clinical experience of the author. A pilot study (Saunders, W. S. (2010). The Consice Cognitive Status Examination: Mental Status Examination with a Smart-Phone Application. The Florida Psychologist Vol. 60, No. 3, pp. 15-22) was conducted to determine the reliabilty and validity of this tool. This tool demonstrated reliability and validity when compared to other mental status examination screening instruments that measure broad cognitive abilities. This tool is meant as a beginning screening test to start a conversation with your loved ones. Give the test with an attitude of compassion and love. You will get better results that way. You should consider consulting an experienced professional in conjunction with a physical examination, a biopsychosocial history, and other psychological, cognitive, and neuropsychological testing for the most accurate diagnosis. This screening instrument should never be relied upon as the sole basis for making any determination about a person. This screening instrument should be used as a general guide for helping to make a competent clinical judgment within the context of a full Neuropsychogical examination.\n\n</string>
